# SwiftUI Slots App

The SwiftUI Slots App is a fun and straightforward slot machine game built with SwiftUI. It allows users to experience the thrill of gambling without any real-world risk. With its simple interface and engaging gameplay, it's perfect for quick entertainment breaks.

## Features

## How It Works

1. **Spinning:** Users can choose between a standard spin, which only changes the middle row, or a Max Spin, which changes all symbols.
2. **Winning Combinations:** The app evaluates the symbols for winning combinations, adjusting the player's credits based on the outcome.
3. **Credits:** Players manage their credits, deciding on each spin whether to play it safe or go big.

### Game Structure

The game uses a combination of ZStack for the background layering, VStack for the main layout, and HStack for organizing the symbols into rows. Action buttons at the bottom allow the player to control their spins.

### Customization

The `symbols` array can be modified to introduce new symbols, changing the game's theme. Adjustments to the `betAmount` or the logic within `Processbutton` and `Processwinning` functions can tailor the game's challenge level.
